## My process

I have developed using a Desktop First approach. I implemented the components piece by piece, when this was done I combined them and made the layout more responsive.
I tried implementing Glassmorphism but it did not appear that great on this component due to the conflicting background colors.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I have learned a bit more about Glassmorphism and image overlaying with hover states.
